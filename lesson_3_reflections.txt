#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

*You would want to use a remote repository if you are working from a computer that 
*is not your own, or if you are collaborating with someone else on a project.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
#automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

*You would want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
*automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository, as you will 
*not always want all of the changes that are being added to the remote
*repository, especially if some of the changes to the remote are just 
*parts of a feature that you have no involvement in 

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
#When would you use one instead of another?

*A fork is a copy of another repo on the GH servers
*A clone is a copy of a repository from GH to a local machine 
*or from a location on a local machine to another local on the same machine
*A branch is an addition to a repository

*You use forks when you would like to edit someone else's repo and you don't 
*necessarily have their permission to directly edit it
*You would use a clone when you're downloading a repo from GH to your local 
*machine to make changes
*You would use a branch when you are working on a new or experimental feature
*and you don't expect it to be production quality ie. there may be bugs
