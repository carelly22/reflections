#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

*You would want to use a remote repository if you are working from a computer that 
*is not your own, or if you are collaborating with someone else on a project.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
#automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

*You would want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
*automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository, as you will 
*not always want all of the changes that are being added to the remote
*repository, especially if some of the changes to the remote are just 
*parts of a feature that you have no involvement in
