#What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

*When you intialize a repository, you create an empty repository in a directory
*You need to do this to create a new repository from scratch

#How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
#repository? What value do you think it offers?

*the staging directory is the are where files are put from the working directory prior 
*to being committed to the repository
*it allows you to make sure that you are committing exactly what you want to commit
*you can check to see what you are committing here first to be sure before making 
*the commit

#How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

*you can use the staging area to make sure you've made one logical commit per change by
*comparing your working directory and the staging area 

#What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
#organized? How would branches help?

*create a new branch when you're moving on to a different piece of work, doing something 
*different, switching contexts
*example: when you're correcting a bug or working on a new feature
*help you to stay organised esp when you're sharing your work publicly 
*you have your master branch which is your production quality work which never breaks 
*then can have a dev branch where active work is taking place 
*experimental branch of new features which you're working on but you fully expect
*them to break; not production quality - communicate this to your audience
*good to collaborate with yourself as well - can context switch
