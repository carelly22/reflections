#How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

*There was a smaller amount of code to look through
*It was easy to see what changed with the + and - structure

#How did having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

*You can easily see when certain changes were made
*Can easily correct mistakes if you know when the file was edited
*Can revert the file back to a time when there was not a mistake

#What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs 
#having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

*Pros
*user-chosen commit, more likely to have a purpose
*more likely to be correctly sized commit

*Cons
*based on user judgement, can make a bad judgement call on the size of the commit
